    <h3>A Yummy and Delicious Spaghetti</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta made from durum wheat, water, and sometimes eggs. The name comes from the Italian word spaghetto, meaning "little string". It is a staple of Italian cuisine and is often served with sauces like tomato-based, meat, or vegetable sauces.</p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water, add a generous amount of salt, and bring it to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Add the spaghetti noodles to the boiling water and stir to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti according to the package directions until it reaches your desired tenderness, or al dente, which is still firm to the bite.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes soft and translucent, then add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until it is fully browned.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomato sauce and tomato paste, add the Italian seasoning, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper, and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for at least 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Before draining the pasta, reserve about a cup of the starchy pasta water.</li>
        <li>Drain the cooked spaghetti using a colander.</li>
        <li>Add the drained spaghetti directly to the skillet with the sauce and toss to combine, adding a splash of the reserved pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve the spaghetti hot, topped with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley or basil.</li>
    </ol>
