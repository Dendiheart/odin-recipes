    <h3>A Yummy and Delicious Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish made by baking layers of pasta sheets, sauce, cheese, and other fillings in a casserole dish. While its exact origin is debated, it has been a staple of Italian cuisine since the Middle Ages. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Ground meat (often a mix of beef and Italian sausage)</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (can be from canned tomatoes, tomato paste, or marinara sauce)</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Italian herbs (such as oregano and basil)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Béchamel sauce (butter, flour, and milk) (in some traditional variations)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the meat sauce: Sauté onion and garlic in olive oil, then brown the ground beef and Italian sausage. Stir in the tomato sauce and seasonings, and simmer.</li>
        <li>Make the cheese filling: Mix ricotta, eggs, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Pre-cook the noodles (if using): Boil lasagna noodles according to package directions until al dente, or use no-boil noodles.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Add a layer of noodles, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture, then more meat sauce, and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers until ingredients are used, ending with sauce and a final layer of mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Add béchamel (optional): If using, layer the béchamel sauce between some of the other layers.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 45 minutes, then uncover and bake for another 15 minutes until bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Rest and serve: Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting.</li>
    </ol>
