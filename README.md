<h3>This project will be a website test of all my knowledge in HTML.</h3>

<p>I created a website with 3 relative links of different recipes.
I also utilized adding images and using the order list and un-ordered list.
Additionally, I mastered the use of a href while not forgetting the attributes on them, same with the img. All in all, this was a fun activity and hope you like my creation :)</p>
